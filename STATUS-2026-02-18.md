# WBAB Status Report - 2026-02-18

## Current Status: v0.3.7 (Production Stable)
The project has achieved a major milestone with the release of `v0.3.7`. This version stabilizes the production-hardened architecture, resolving all identified CI/CD permission and formatting issues.

### Achievements (Session)
- [x] **v0.3.7 Official Release**: Successfully tagged and published all toolchain images to GHCR.
- [x] **CI/CD Stabilization**: Resolved "Permission Denied" and `sqlite3` errors in GitHub Actions using `sudo chmod -R a+w .` and explicit directory cleanup.
- [x] **E2E Test Modernization**: Updated `tests/e2e/test_wbab_pipeline_mocked.sh` with dynamic version detection and proper module isolation.
- [x] **Toolchain Cleanup**: Implemented `rm -rf out/dist` in `build-real.sh` and `package-real.sh` to ensure clean state transitions.
- [x] **Floating Tags**: Established the `latest` tag in both Git and GHCR, aligned with `v0.3.7`.

### Repository State
- **Branch**: `master` (aligned with `latest`)
- **Tests**: 100% Pass in CI (Lint, Shell, Contract, Policy, E2E)
- **Toolchain**: Defaulting to `v0.3.7` / `latest`.

## Next Steps
1. **Operations Dashboard (Issue #7)**: Begin implementation of the web-based monitoring interface.
2. **TLS by Default (Issue #8)**: Enforce HTTPS for all daemon communication using the internal PKI.
3. **Declarative Dependencies (Issue #3)**: Implement the "Vending Machine" for external binaries.

## Session Context for Resume
- All core documentation has been synchronized to `v0.3.7`.
- The `v0.3.x` release line is now the stable baseline for all new feature development.
- The `WBAB_MOCK_EXECUTOR=1` requirement is confirmed and tested for shell unit tests.
