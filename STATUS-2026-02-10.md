# Project Status - 2026-02-10

**Milestone:** Bring-up Scaffold Complete & Verified

## Achievements
- **Correctness**: Fixed critical race condition in `OperationStore` using `fcntl` file locking.
- **Formal Verification**: Expanded TLA+ model (`DaemonIdempotency.tla`) to cover full daemon lifecycle, including step-level retry/resume.
- **Toolchain**: Implemented real build (`cmake`/`make`) and packaging (`nsis`) logic in `tools/winbuild/build-real.sh` and `tools/packaging/package-real.sh`.
- **Validation**: Created robust `samples/validation-app` (C++ DLL/CLI/GUI) and verified it with a full `wbab build -> package -> sign -> smoke` lifecycle.
- **Automation**: Enhanced `wbab smoke` to support automated file extraction and content verification from WineBot containers.
- **Documentation**: Added `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` and updated `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
- **Security**: Updated GitHub Action dependencies (`hadolint` v3.3.0, `trivy` 0.29.0) and verified policy gates.

## Current State
- The system is fully functional, verified by `tests/e2e/run.sh` and manual smoke tests of the sample app.
- All lint, contract, and policy checks pass.
- Repository is ready for the first official release of toolchain images.

## Next Steps
1.  **Release**: Tag `v0.3.3` and push to `main`.
2.  **Publish**: Trigger the `publish-ghcr` workflow to build and push the `winbuild`, `packaging`, and `signing` images to GHCR.
3.  **Consume**: Update `wbab` defaults to use the new `v0.3.3` tag instead of `stable` once published.

## Session Notes
- `wbab smoke` now supports `WBAB_SMOKE_EXTRACT_PATH` and `WBAB_SMOKE_EXPECT_CONTENT` for automated assertions.
- The `ValidationGUI` app includes a threaded timeout mechanism to ensure reliable termination in headless smoke tests.
