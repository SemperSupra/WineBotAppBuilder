# WBAB Status Report - 2026-02-17

## Current Status: v0.3.5 (Verified)
The toolchain has successfully passed a full local build and verification cycle. A syntax error in `sign-real.sh` detected during CI for `v0.3.0` has been resolved in `v0.3.5`.

### Achievements (Session)
- [x] **Persistence Migration**: Completed the transition from JSON/JSONL to SQLite for all state and audit logs.
- [x] **Security Hardening**: Implemented Non-Root containers and the Remote RCE Guard (direct `docker run`).
- [x] **Test Modernization**: Updated the entire `tests/shell/` suite to support SQLite and containerized execution.
- [x] **Toolchain Refinement**: Implemented `wbab-sign-real` and updated Dockerfiles for consistent entrypoints.
- [x] **Documentation Sync**: Synchronized all guides, policies, and contracts with the new architecture.

### Repository State
- **Branch**: `master` (ahead of `v0.3.5`)
- **Tests**: 100% Pass (Lint, Shell, Contract, Policy, E2E)
- **Toolchain**: Defaults updated to `v0.3.5`.

## Next Steps
1. **v0.3.5 Release**: Tag and publish the finalized hardened toolchain.
2. **Operations Dashboard (Issue #7)**: Begin implementation of the web-based monitoring interface.
3. **Declarative Dependencies (Issue #3)**: Implement the "Vending Machine" for external binaries.

## Session Context for Resume
- The `WBAB_MOCK_EXECUTOR=1` flag is now required for running shell unit tests.
- The `agent-sandbox/state/` directory contains `.sqlite` files; legacy `.json` files should be ignored/removed.
