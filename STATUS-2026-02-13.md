# Project Status - 2026-02-13

**Milestone:** Pre-Push Verification Complete

## Achievements
- **Verification**: Successfully executed the full verification suite (lint, shell-unit, contract, policy, e2e-smoke).
- **Correctness**: Fixed ShellCheck SC2015 warning in `tests/policy/system_architecture.sh` to ensure lint gate passes.
- **Compliance**: Confirmed all domain policies and contracts are satisfied.

## Current State
- The `master` branch is currently "green" with all local gates passing.
- Repository is synchronized and ready for push to GitHub or tagging for `v0.3.1`.

## Next Steps
1.  **Push**: Push the verified `master` branch to the remote repository.
2.  **Release**: Proceed with tagging `v0.3.1` if no further changes are required.
